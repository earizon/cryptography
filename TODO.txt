##  Avoiding Uniqueness of IV

... To avoid initialization vector (IV) uniqueness, instead of using
the Master Key to encrypt all token objects, the MK is used to wrap a 
per-object key using the _AES Key Wrap_ algorithm. The wrapped 
per-object key is stored together with the IV and other meta-data as 
additional authenticated data (AAD) in the authenticated object 
header. The 16 byte GMAC tag is appended to the authenticated and 
encrypted object body which holds the private token object’s

## sha256 vs modem adaptive one-way pass encoders 
* <https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/5.3.2.RELEASE/reference/html5/>
  Because adaptive one-way functions are intentionally resource 
intensive, validating a username and password for every request will 
degrade performance of an application significantly. There is nothing 
Spring Security (or any other library) can do to speed up the 
validation of the password since security is gained by making the 
validation resource intensive. Users are encouraged to exchange the 
long term credentials (i.e. username and password) for a short term 
credential (i.e. session, OAuth Token, etc). The short term 
credential can be validated quickly without any loss in security.

## encryption algorithms and operation modes leaking  [[{101}]]
    plaintext Leaks:  length of plaintext, exacerbated when 
    the plaintext is initially compressed, because the length
    of the compressed plaintext and, thus, the ciphertext
    depends not only on the length of the original plaintext
    but also on its content.
    **COMPRESSION ATTACKS ARE PARTICULARLY POWERFUL WHEN 
      THERE IS ATTACKER-CONTROLLED DATA IN THE SAME COMPRESSION
      SPACE AS SECRET DATA**
  * See [Kelsey] for general background on compression and
    encryption and [Alawatugoda] for a specific example of 
    attacks on HTTP cookies.


## Insecure Use of Elliptic Curve Encryption  [[{101}]]
  C&P from <https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc8725.html>
  Per [Sanso], several Javascript Object Signing and 
  Encryption (JOSE) libraries fail to validate their inputs
  correctly when performing elliptic curve key agreement
  (the "ECDH-ES" algorithm). An attacker that is able to
  send JWEs of its choosing that use invalid curve points
  and observe the cleartext outputs resulting from decryption
  with the invalid curve points can use this vulnerability
  to recover the recipient's private key.


## Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) signatures [[{101}]]
  require a unique random value for every message that is signed.
  If even just a few bits of the random value are predictable
  across multiple messages, then the security of the signature
  scheme may be compromised. In the worst case, the private key
  may be recoverable by an attacker.

## Zenroom
* https://github.com/dyne/Zenroom
  Embedded no-code VM executing human-like language to manipulate data and process cryptographic operations. 

Zenroom is a secure language interpreter of the domain-specific Zencode, making it easy to execute fast cryptographic operations on any data structure.

The Zenroom VM is very small, has no external dependency, is fully deterministic and is ready to run end-to-end encryption on any platform: desktop, embedded mobile, cloud micro-services, and web browsers. Zenroom works inside applications written in Javascript, Python3, Rust or Golang.

Zencode has a no-code approach. It is a domain-specific language (DSL) similar to human language. One can process large data structures through complex cryptographic and logical transformations.

Zencode helps developers to empower people who know what to do with data: one can write and review business logic and data-sensitive operations without learning to code.

Google has open-sourced a general-purpose transpiler able to convert high-level code to be used with Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE).

While FHE is attracting a lot of interest from several companies,
including IBM and Microsoft, here Google is attempting a novel
approach by creating a transpiler to transform a program written in a
high-level language and working with non-encrypted data into an
FHE-ready version.
  Google’s transpiler will enable developers to write code for any
type of basic computation such as simple string processing or math,
and run it on encrypted data.

## Proxy Re-encryption (PRE) [[{qa.UX]]
 https://www.nucypher.com/proxy-re-encryption
  Proxy re-encryption (PRE) is a type of public-key encryption (PKE)
  that allows a proxy entity to transform or re-encrypt data from one
  public key to another, without having access to the underlying
  plaintext or private keys.

  - Alice uses PrivKey_a to decrypt PubKey_a messages.
  - Alice generates re-encryption PubKey_a_to_b (a_to_b == "Alice 2 Bob")
    and sends it to trusted PROXY (e.g: e-mail server)
  - PROXY uses the PubKey_a_to_b to re-encrypt any messages
    arriving signed with PubKey_a.
  - Bob now can fetch the new encrypted-with-PubKey_a_to_b message
    and decrypt it with its own private key.
  - The PROXY has no way to decrypt the original or new encrypted messages

Aggregate Signature protocols:
.... CoSi protocol is based on SCHNORR SIGNATURE AGGREGATION,
     which is an INTERACTIVE protocol:
     aggregated Schnorr-signature for a single message
     requires all  the  singers  collaboration to generate
     1) shared challenge-string in the "Challenge" phase of CoSi-protocol.
     2) challenge-string of 1) as input for each signer to
        generate its SIGNATURE SHARE.
     Hence:
     - A LEADER IS REQUIRED TO ORCHESTRATE THE WHOLE PROCESS.
     - protocol  needs  to  take  multiple  rounds.

 ...  our  aggregated  signature  gossip  protocol is based on
      NON-INTERACTIVE BLS SIGNATURE AGGREGATION SCHEME.
     Hence:
     - coordination  among nodes is eliminated.
     - instead  of communication tree, gossip protocol is

## https://academy.bit2me.com/en/que-es-wallet-mpc/  MPC: Multi Party Computing
Due to its great possibilities, the community cripto has remained
strongly interested in this type of technology. In fact, David Chaum
In 1988, he presented a well-known work under the name of
"Unconditionally secure multi-party protocols". On the other hand,
Nick Szabo, in 1999 he also presented a well-known work called "God's  <·····!!!
protocols", also explaining the possibilities of MPCs in the world of
computing and their use in economic and financial systems. This
offers us a clear idea of the importance of these protocols,
and their arrival in the world of cryptocurrencies.


## The God Protocols: November 15, 1999, Nick Szabo,
  https://web.archive.org/web/20061230075325/http:/www.theiia.org/ITAudit/index.cfm?act=itaudit.archive&fid=216

  Imagine the ideal protocol. It would have the most trustworthy third
  party imaginable — a deity who is on everybody's side. All the
  parties would send their input to this god. God would reliably
  determine the results and return the output. In addition, God, being
  the ultimate in confessional discretion, would ensure that no party
  would learn anything more about the other party's input than they
  could learn from their own input and the output.

  Alas, in our temporal world we deal with humans rather than deities.
  Yet, too often we are forced to treat people in a nearly god-like
  manner because our infrastructure lacks the security needed to
  protect ourselves.

  Trusted Third Party:

  F1

  To an astonishing extent, network security theorists have recently
  solved this problem. They have developed protocols that create
  virtual machines between two or more parties. Multi-party secure
  computation allows any number of parties to share a computation, each
  learning only what can be inferred from their own input and the
  output of the computation. These virtual machines have the exciting
  property that each party's input is held in strict confidence from
  the other parties. The program and the output are shared by the
  parties.

  For example, we could run a spreadsheet across the Internet on this
  virtual computer. We would agree on a set of formulas and set up the
  virtual computer with these formulas. Each participant would have
  their own input cells, which remain blank on the other participants'
  computers. The participants share output cell(s). Each participant
  inputs their own private data into their input cells. Alice could
  only learn as much about the other participants' input cells as she
  could infer from her own inputs and outputs.

  Mathematically Trustworthy Protocol:

  F2

  There are three major limitations. The first is that this virtual
  computer is very slow: in some cases, one arithmetic calculation per
  network message. Currently, it is at best practical only for small
  logic or arithmetic calculations used as an adjunct to or component
  of more efficient computations and protocols.

  The second is that there is a tradeoff between privacy, fairness, and
  fault tolerance. Fairness means everybody learning the results in
  such a way that no one can gain an advantage by learning first. Fault
  tolerance can provide robustness against a minority, so that it takes
  a majority dropping out to halt the protocol, or it can be non-robust
  but fail-stop, so that a single participant can terminate the
  protocol. Many papers have discussed the fraction of parties one must
  trust in order to be assured of learning the correct output. In
  traditional results, fairness and privacy could not both be achieved
  with a faulty majority. Recent papers [3-6] have produced fair and
  private protocols even with faulty majorities. They trade robustness
  for privacy and fairness against any proportion of faulty parties.
  The advantage of this fail-stop approach is that you can usually find
  new partners and start over again, but you don’t want to suffer
  irreversible losses such as leaking information, being left holding
  the bag, or being convinced of an incorrect result.

  The third limitation is that, far from being omniscient or
  omnipotent, the protocol will accomplish only what is specified in
  the algorithm and the inputs. It won't be able to replace
  human-trusted third parties where those parties provide insight or
  knowledge that cannot be provided by a computer.

  With these caveats, any algorithmic intermediary can, in principle,
  be replaced by a trustworthy virtual computer. In practice, because
  of the three limitations, we usually construct more limited protocols
  out of more efficient elements.

  Multi-party computation theory has major implications, in theory, for
  all kinds of contractual relationships. This can be seen most clearly
  in the area of negotiations. A mechanism in economics is an abstract
  model of an institution which communicates with its participants via
  messages, and whose rules can be specified algorithmically. These
  institutions can be auctions, exchanges, voting, and so on. They
  typically implement some kind of negotiation or decision-making
  process.

  Economists assume a trusted intermediary operates the mechanism.
  Here's a simple example of using this virtual computer for a
  mechanism. Alice can submit a bid price, and Bob an ask price, then
  their shared virtual program which has one instruction, "A greater
  than B?" The computer then returns "true" if Alice's bid is greater
  than Bob's offer. A slightly more sophisticated computer may then
  decide the settlement price according to a number of different
  algorithms (Alice's bid, Bob's ask, split the difference, etc.). This
  implements the mechanism blind bargaining with no trusted
  intermediary.

  In principle, since any computable problem can be solved on this
  virtual computer (they are Turing complete), any computable economic
  mechanism can be implemented without a trusted intermediary. In
  practice, we face the three limitations discussed previously, but the
  proof that any economic mechanism can be run without a trusted
  intermediary is very exciting. This means that, in principle, any
  contract that can be negotiated through a trusted third party (such
  as an auction or exchange) can be negotiated directly. So, in some
  abstract sense, the only remaining hard problems in smart contract
  negotiations are (a) problems considered hard even with a trusted
  intermediary (for the standard economic reasons), and (b) the task of
  algorithmically specifying the negotiating rules and output contract
  terms. (This includes cases where an intermediary adds knowledge
  unavailable to the participants, such as a lawyer giving advice on
  how to draft a contract.) In practice, many problems that can be
  solved in principle with multi-party computation will reoccur when we
  implement protocols in an efficient, practical manner. The God
  Protocols give us a target to shoot for.

  Applying this kind of analysis to the performance phase of contracts
  is less straightforward. For starters, economic theories of the
  performance phase are not as well developed or simple as the
  mechanism theory of negotiations. Indeed, most economic theory simply
  assumes that all contracts can be perfectly enforced cost-free. Some
  of the transaction cost literature has started to move beyond this
  assumption, but there are few compelling results or consensus
  theories in the area of techniques and costs of contract enforcement.

  Performance phase analysis with multi-party secure computer theory
  would seem to apply only to those contracts that can be performed
  inside the virtual computer. But the use of post-unforgeable auditing
  logs, combined with running auditing protocols inside the shared
  virtual computer, allows a wide variety of performances outside the
  virtual computer to at least be observed and verified by selected
  arbitrators.

  The participants in this mutually confidential auditing protocol can
  verify that the books match the details of transactions stored in a
  previously committed transaction log, and that the numbers add up
  correctly. The participants can compute summary statistics on their
  confidentially shared transaction logs, including cross-checking of
  the logs against counterparties to a transaction, without revealing
  those logs. They only learn what can be inferred from the statistics,
  cannot see the details of the transactions. Another intriguing
  possibility is that the virtual computer can keep state over long
  periods of time, allowing sophisticated forms of privy and
  self-enforcing secured credit.

  If mutually confidential auditing ever becomes practical, we will be
  able to gain high confidence in the factuality of counterparties'
  claims and reports without revealing identifying and other detailed
  information from the transactions underlying those reports. These
  would provide the basis for solid reputation systems, and other
  trusted third-party systems, that maintain integrity across time,
  communications, summarization, and preserve confidentiality for
  transaction participants. Knowing that mutually confidential auditing
  can be accomplished in principle will hopefully lead us to practical
  solutions to these important problems.

## Kerberos protocol: [[{protocol.kerberos,crypt_symmetric,crypt_asymmetric]]
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerberos_(protocol)>
<https://web.mit.edu/Kerberos/>
- computer-network protocol designed to
  provide strong client/server mutual authentication

-  built on symmetric key cryptography  and
   may (optionally) use public-key cryptography
   during certain phases of authentication
-  requires a trusted third party
-  works on the basis of tickets
- allow nodes communicating over a non-secure network
  to prove their identity to one another in a secure manner,
  protecting against eavesdropping and replay attacks.

 History and development
- 19?? MIT 1st Kerberos version
  based on the earlier Needham–Schroeder symmetric key protocol.
- Versions 1-3 were only MIT internals.

- Late 1980s: version 4 (by Steve Miller and Clifford Neuman)

- 1993: Version 5, becomes also RFC 1510

- 2000: Default authentication method in Windows 2000
        - RFC 3244 documents Microsoft additions to the standard
          suite of protocols:
        "Microsoft Windows 2000 Ker. Change and Set Password Proto."
        RFC 4757 documents Microsoft's use of the RC4 cipher.
        Kerberos is used as preferred authentication method:
        In general, joining a client to a Windows domain means
        enabling Kerberos as default protocol for authentications
        from that client to services in the Windows domain and
        all domains with trust relationships to that domain.
       (fallback to NTLM ifeither client or server are not joined to a domain*


- 2005: RFC 4120 makes (1993) RFC 1510 obsolet. Updates by IETF included:
  - Encryption and Checksum Specifications (RFC 3961)
  - AES (RFC 3962)
  - new edition of the Kerberos V5 spec
    "The Kerberos Network Authentication Service (V5)" (RFC 4120).
  - new edition of
    "The Kerberos V5 Generic Security Service API (GSS-API) Mechanism: Version 2." (RFC 4121).

- 2???: MIT implementation freely available (BSD license)

- 2007: MIT formed the Kerberos Consortium to foster continued development.
        Founding sponsors include Oracle, Apple, Google, Microsoft, Centrify Corporation, TeamF1,
        Royal Institute of Technology in Sweden, Stanford University, MIT, CyberSafe.

 Protocol Description

participant client
participant Service Server          as SS
participant Auth.Server             as AS
participant Key.Distribution.Center as KDC
participant Ticket.Gathering.System as TGS
            ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
            Ussually KDC and TGS share the
            same host

PRE-SETUP: Register SPN at TGS with a Service Principal Name (SPN01)
SS → TGS: Register SPN01

LOGIN-FASE: Gathering new TGT (ticket-granting ticket)
  client →  client: username01, password01
  client →  client: alt 1: key01 = chiper(secret_key, password01)
                    alt 2: key01 = hash  (password01)
  client →  AS: username01
  AS     → KDC: username01
  KDC    → KDC: issues new TGT01
                           -----
                           - time-stamp
                           - expiration-time

  KDC    → KDC: encryptedTGT01 = sym_cipher(secret_key, TGT01)
  KDC    → client: encryptedTGT01 (usually at user logon)


STEP 2: Communicating with other nodes ("principal")
  client → TGS: TGT01 + SPN01
                        ^^^^^
                        SPN01 registered in PRE-SETUP.
  TGS    → TGS: verify TGT01
                verify client is allowed access to TG01
  TGS    → client: Session Ticket st01 + Session Keys
  client → SS: session ticket st01 + sess.keys + service request

 Drawbacks and limitations
- Kerberos requires user accounts, user clients
  and the services on the server to all have a
  trusted relationship to the Kerberos token server
  All must be in the same Kerberos domain or in domains
  that have a trust relationship between each other.
  - creating staged environments (e.g. separate domains for
    test, pre-production, production) is difficult.


 Kerberos delegation
- Kerberos delegation is used in multi-tier application/service situations:
-  A common scenario would be a web server application making calls to
   a database running on another server.
   -  The first tier is the user who browses to the web site’s URL.
   -  The second tier is the web site.
   -  The third or data tier would be the database.
   Delegation allows the database to know who is actually accessing its data

  Non-Kerberos Security Setup:
    webserver_admin → database1_admin : request database  access for "WebServerAcct"
    database1_admin → database1_admin : grant "sufficient" access to "Database1Acct"
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    webapp developers and/or admins determine who can access the web application
    and by extension the data in the back end.
      (it may be unacceptable to the database admins as they cannot control wh
       ultimately has access to the data)

  Kerberos delegation Setup:
    - grant "WebServerAcct" permission to delegate to the "Database1Acct".
      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
      When a user accesses the web site they authenticate with Windows Integrated Authentication:
      user → webserver: request + user-kerberos-ticket1
                                  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
                                  contains a list of the user's
                                  AD group memberships.

      webserver → webserver: check that user-kerberos-ticket1 is in Database group
      webserver → AD controller: (delegation configure)
                                 request a Kerberos ticket to the database
                                 impersonating the user rather than "WebServerAcct"
      ...
      webserver → Database1: request + user-kerberos-ticket2
      Database1 → Database1: check that user-kerberos-ticket1 is allowed

## LDAP [[{use_case.AAA.activeDirectory,protocol.LDAP]]
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_Directory_Access_Protocol>

- application protocol for accessing and maintaining distributed
  directory information services over an Internet Protocol (IP) network.

- Directory services roles:
  - share information about users and services throughout the network,
    like mails, phones, user/passwords, ...

 History
- 1980s: Telco companies develop the concept of directory services
         culminating in the comprehensive X.500 specification
         by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) in the 1980s.

- 1993 : First version created as a subset of X.500 for TCP/IP
         While the X.500 was "heavy" in network bandwith, LDAP was
         "light", better suited for TCP/IP at that time.

- 1997: LDAPv3
        - added support for extensibility
        - integrates Simple Authentication and Security Layer

- 2006: Latest version (RFC 4511)
        road map to the technical specifications is provided by [RFC4510]
        - The Protocol [RFC4511]
        - Directory Information Models [RFC4512]
        - Authentication Methods and Security Mechanisms [RFC4513]
        - Uniform Resource Locator [RFC4516]
        - ...

 operation can be:
 - StartTLS    :

 - Search      : search for and/or retrieve directory entries
 - Compare     : test if a named entry contains a given attribute value
 - Add    entry:
 - Delete entry:
 - Modify entry:
 - Modify DN   : move/rename an (D)istinguished (N)ame

      Note: dc stands for (D)omain (C)omponent

- A server holds:
  - a subtree starting from a specific entry*
    For example: "dc=example,dc=com"
  - (optional) references to other servers
    an attempt to access a dn in other server will
    return a server-referral to the client.
    - (optional) some servers support chaining:
      - The server will directly contact the other
        servers on behalf of the client

                                                        - sub (tree)

 Directory Schema
- set of rules (definitions and constraints) concerning
  the structure of the directory information tree (DIT),
  or what information the server can hold.
  - Attribute Syntaxes: Provide info about the kind of info that can be stored in an attribute.
  - Matching Rules    : Provide information about how to make comparisons against attribute values.
  - Matching Rule Uses: Indicate which attribute types may be used in conjunction
                        with a particular matching rule.
  - Attribute Types   : Define an object identifier (OID) and a set of names that may be
                        used to refer to a given attribute, and associates that attribute with a
                        syntax and set of matching rules.
  - Object Classes    : Define named collections of attributes and classify them into sets of
                        required and optional attributes.
                        ObjectClasses can be inherited.
  - Name Forms        : Define rules for the set of attributes that should be included in the
                        RDN for an entry.
  - Content Rules     : Define additional constraints about the object classes and attributes
                        that may be used in conjunction with an entry.
  - Structure Rule    : Define rules that govern the kinds of subordinate entries that a given
                        entry may have.

  NOTE : Clients may learn about the schema elements that the server supports
         by retrieving an appropriate subschema subentry.

- A schema for representing individual people within organizations is termed a white pages schema.

 Access control is not standardized   though there are commonly used models.

 LDAP extension point
  - define new operations.
  - modify requests/responses (sort results,...)
  - New search scopes and Bind methods can be defined.
  - new attributes options modifying their semantics.
  - ...

 Access protocol
- As LDAP has gained momentum, vendors have provided it
   as an access protocol to other services
  For example, Unix user and group information (via PAM, NSS modules)
- LDAP is often used by other services for authentication.

 Usage
- two common styles of naming:
  - top level objects are the c= (country) object
    Ex:
                    l=Locality, ou=Some Organizational Unit, o=Some Organization,        c=FR
    cn=Common Name, l=Locality, ou=Some Organizational Unit, o=Some Organization, st=CA, c=US

  - top level objects are domains
    Ex:
    cn=Common Name, dc=example,  dc=com

## Active Directory: [[{use_case.AAA.activeDirectory,protocol.kerberos,protocol.ldap]]
Active Directory LDAP requires that names of directory objects be
formed according to RFC 1779 and RFC 2247:
- <https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2247.txt>
    This document defines an algorithm by which a name registered with
    the Internet DNS can be represented as an LDAP distinguished name.

    subdomain.com  ←→  dc=subdomain,dc=com

    The algorithm for transforming a domain name is to begin with an
    empty distinguished name (DN) and then attach Relative Distinguished
    Names (RDNs) for each component of the domain, most significant (e.g.
    rightmost) first. Each of these RDNs is a single AttributeTypeAndValue,
    where  the type is the attribute "DC"  and
           the value is an IA5 string containing the domain name component

    Two LDAP object classes are also defined.
    - dcObject: to integrate into alreaded existing schemas,
                alowing the dc attribute to be present in an entry.
    -   domain: structural object class used for entries in which no
                other information is being stored

- <https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1779.txt>
    X.500/LDAP distinguished names (primary keys) are encoded in ASN.1.
    there is a need to have a user-oriented string representation of DNs.
    ("human to human")

Une collaboration internationale impliquant la chaire photonique au sein du laboratoire LMOPS de CentraleSupélec et de l’université de Lorraine (Metz), l’université de Yale (États-Unis), Trinity College Dublin (Irlande), Imperial College London (Royaume-Uni), et Nanyang Technological University (Singapour), a mis au point un laser générant plus de 250 trillions (250 milliards de milliards) de nombres aléatoires par seconde. Un résultat majeur, alors que le précédent record était de 560 milliards de nombres aléatoires en 2014, déjà détenu par la chaire photonique. Marc Sciamanna, enseignant chercheur à CentraleSupélec, nous explique les enjeux d'un tel record.

## Crypto I2PA: An Efficient ABC for IoT
* <https://hal.science/hal-02264662v1>
* In this paper, we propose an efficient attribute-based credential 
  scheme for IoT devices. We use elliptic curve cryptography without 
  pairing, blind signing, and zero-knowledge proof. Our scheme supports 
  block signing, selective disclosure, and randomization. It provides 
  data minimization and transaction unlinkability.
*  Our construction is efficient since smaller key size can be used, 
  and computing time can be reduced. As a result, it is a suitable 
  solution for IoT devices characterized by three major constraints, 
  namely low-energy power, small storage capacity, and low computing 
  power.

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/991758/how-to-get-pem-file-from-key-and-crt-files

Q: How can I create a PEM file from an SSL certificate?

  These are the files that I have available:
  
  ```
  .crt
  server.csr
  server.key
  ```
  
  Answer: Your keys may already be in PEM format, but just named with .crt or .key.
  
  If the file's content begins with `-----BEGIN` and you can read it in a text editor:
    The file uses base64, which is readable in ASCII, not binary 
  format. The certificate is already in PEM format. Just change the 
  extension to .pem.
  If the file is in binary:
  
  For the server.crt, you would use
  ```
  | $ openssl x509 -inform DER -outform PEM -in server.crt -out server.crt.pem
  ```
  For server.key, use openssl rsa in place of openssl x509.
  
  The server.key is likely your private key, and the .crt file is the returned, signed, x509 certificate.
  
  If this is for a Web server and you cannot specify loading a separate private and public key:
  
  You may need to concatenate the two files. For this use:
  
  ```
  | $ cat server.crt server.key > server.includesprivatekey.pem
  ```
  
  I would recommend naming files with "includesprivatekey" to help you manage the permissions you keep with this file.
