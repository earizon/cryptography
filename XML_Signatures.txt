<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML_Signature>
* also called XMLDSig, XML-DSig, XML-Sig
* XML syntax for digital signatures
* W3C recommendation
* it has much in common with PKCS#7 but is more extensible
* used by various XML related technologies like SOAP or SAML
* typically toto sign XML documents,
  but anything that is accessible via a URL can be signed
* An XML signature used to sign a resource outside its containing
  XML document is called a detached signature;
* If used to sign some part of its containing document, it is
  called an enveloped signature;
* if it contains the signed data within itself it is called an
  enveloping signature.
* creation of XML Signatures is substantially more complex
  than the creation of an ordinary digital signature because
  a given XML Document may have more than one legal serialized
  representation<br/>
  XML canonicalization transform is employed to alleviated some of
  those problems<br/>
  (See detailed description in Wikipedia source)
* Modern alternatives to XML and XML Signature include:
  * JSON, replacing XML with a familiar and cleaner Javascript notation.
  * JWT, (JSON Web Token) for an standard method of signing JSON documents.
    Used "everywhere" in OAuth/OpenID (See related notes on the [Identity](./index.html) 
* NOTE: "*AdES" formats are the ones widely legally accepted for business transactions,
  eg. eInvoincing.

## OASIS XAdES (X)ML (Ad)vanced (E)lectronic (S)ignatures

* <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XAdES>
  The Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) is the IETF's standard
  for cryptographically protected messages. It can be used to
  digitally sign, digest, authenticate or encrypt any form of
  digital data.

## OASIS XML DSS (D)igital (S)ignature (S)ervices (Europa.eu) [[{]]

* Not to be confused with Digital Signature -deprecated- Standard DSS.
* <https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=dss>
* <https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/display/CEFDIGITAL/Start+using+Digital+Signature+Services+-+DSSZ
* open-source software library for electronic signature creation and
  validation . DSS supports the creation and verification of interoperable
  and secure electronic signatures in line with European legislation.
  In particular, DSS aims to follow the eIDAS Regulation and related standards closely.

* DSS can be re-used in an IT solution for electronic signatures to ensure that
  signatures are created and verified in line with European legislation and
  standards. DSS allows re-use in a variety of different ways: in an applet, in
  a stand-alone application or in a server application. DSS can also be used as
  a reference implementation for IT solutions which do not directly re-use it.
  Demos are also available to assist the use of DSS as a reference implementation.
* The library,  realised in Java , is open-source, available to all Member States,
  businesses and citizens for re-use in electronic signature solutions. It is
  continuously updated and maintained to anticipate and follow developments in
  regulations and standards.
* Anyone can integrate it and redistribute it under the terms of the Lesser
  General Public License (LGPL 2.1).
* In accordance with ETSI standards, DSS supports various document and
  signature formats including PAdES, XAdES, CAdES and ASiC and is compliant
  with Implementing Decision 2015/1506/EU. A “cook-book” is also provided with
  documentation targeting implementers/developers and aiming at facilitating
  the integration and use of DSS in their applications.
