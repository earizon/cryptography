## Hyperledger Ursa library [[{PM.low_code,PM.TODO,qa.ursalib]]
* <https://www.hyperledger.org/use/ursa>
* Hyperledger Ursa is a shared cryptographic library, it enables
  implementations to avoid duplicating other cryptographic work and
  hopefully increase security in the process. The library is an opt-in
  repository (for Hyperledger and non Hyperledger projects) to place
  and use crypto. Hyperledger Ursa consists of sub-projects, which are
  cohesive implementations of cryptographic code or interfaces to
  cryptographic code.
